# Requirements

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a simple, scalable, and secure system for monitoring water quality in real time.

## Problem Statement

Water quality is a critical issue in many communities, and it is essential to monitor and maintain water quality levels. However, monitoring water quality in real time can be challenging due to the large amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed. This project must a simple way to interpret and visualize water quality data in real time for casual users.

## Project Objectives

- view water quality over time
- visualise the data in the style of a river
- see current water quality at a glance
- interact with the data in an intuitive and visual way
